Project Name: Java Spring Mail with Rate Limiting Interceptor using Bucket4j

Description:

This project seamlessly combines two powerful Java technologies - Spring Mail and Bucket4j - to offer an efficient email sending solution while also implementing a rate limiting interceptor for specific URLs. With a well-structured MVC architecture, it provides a comprehensive solution for email communication and web request management.

Key Features:

Spring Mail Integration: This project simplifies email sending within Java Spring applications. You can effortlessly send emails for notifications, alerts, and communication without dealing with the intricacies of email protocols.

Rate Limiting with Bucket4j: Implementing a robust rate limiting mechanism using Bucket4j, you gain control over the flow of requests to specific URLs. This prevents server overload, safeguards against abuse, and enhances the overall efficiency of your website.

MVC Architecture: Following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, this project ensures a clean and modular codebase. This architecture promotes maintainability and scalability, making it easier to expand and customize the project according to your application's unique needs.

Efficiency Enhancement: By preventing excessive requests to critical URLs, this project significantly boosts the efficiency of your website. This reduction in server load translates to improved user experiences and fewer downtimes.

Usage:

Begin by configuring your email settings in the Spring Mail configuration files.
Define rate limiting rules and policies in the Bucket4j configuration, tailoring them to your application's specific requirements.
Implement the MVC architecture to structure your project, making it more organized and adaptable.
